### ✅ Summary of What You’ve Achieved So Far:

| Component                  | Status         |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Bastion as Control Plane  | ✅ Working     |
| Worker Auto Join via S3   | ✅ Automated   |
| Bootstrap Scripts         | ✅ Standardized |
| Terraform Infrastructure  | ✅ Modular     |
| IAM Roles & S3 Access     | ✅ Secure      |
| CNI (Calico) Networking   | ✅ Stable      |
| Cluster Health            | ✅ Green Nodes |
| Security (Key perms, etc) | ✅ Handled     |

### 🔜 What’s Next in the Big Picture Roadmap?

Since your cluster infra is *production-like* for dev/test purposes, you're spot on — we can pause on infra and resume on **Ansible + App Layer**.

---

### 🛠️ Minor Enhancements for Later (Optional)

> Not needed now, but good to track for “hardening” later:

- ✅ NAT Gateway per AZ for full HA (you mentioned you’ll return to this)
- ⛓️ Replace bastion with dedicated master/control-plane node
- 🔐 TLS bootstrapping for kubelet cert rotation
- 🔁 Auto-scaling workers using Auto Scaling Group + Launch Templates (if desired)
- 📈 Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)
- 🔒 RBAC, PodSecurityPolicies, etc.
- 🔀 Ingress controller + cert-manager
- 🧼 Enable audit logs, enable encryption at rest

### 🚀 Moving to Ansible

You’re totally good to shift gears and go deep into:

1. **Ansible Roles for App Layer**
    - ArgoCD (you started this)
    - Jenkins, Docker, GitLab (if not done yet)
    - App deployment (Room8 microservices)

2. **Ansible Inventory for your EC2 setup**
    - Group `bastion`, `workers`, etc.
    - Use tags or dynamic inventory if needed

3. **Ansible Playbooks for Infra Ops**
    - Cluster status checks
    - Log collection
    - Node draining and updates

---

### 💡 Quick Tip for Your Next Phase

Before writing Ansible playbooks for Room8 app deployments, consider prepping:
- A local `values.yaml` for each microservice (if using Helm)
- Or Docker Compose files to convert into Kubernetes manifests
- Service manifests (K8s `Deployment`, `Service`, `Ingress`, etc.) for each service
